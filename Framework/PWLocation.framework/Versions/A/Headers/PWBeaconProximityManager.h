 The `PWBeaconProximityManager` class defines the interface for configuring the delivery of beacon proximity-related events to your application. You use an instance of this class to establish the parameters that determine when beacon proximity events should be delivered and to start and stop the actual delivery of those events.
 
 The beacon proximity provider receives location data from multiple beacons and selected the closest beacon over a given time period to promote as the current location. While beacon proximity will update fairly frequently (1-2 times/second) the accuracy is suspect and should not be relied on for fine-grained location updates.
